# Alelimon 🍋

## Alelimon is an online clothing store for women in Venezuela. It is a basic website with the idea to introduce the store to the customers and present a different face of the store since the main selling platform used is Instagram and Whatsapp.

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Grid 
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Alelimon provided all the design logos, fonts, colors and photos. 
- I used undraw to support the design. Link -> [Undraw](https://undraw.co/)
